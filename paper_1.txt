The design of dialogue flow and the generation of psychological dialogues are major challenges for conversational agents (chatbots) used in the domain of psychological counselling. 
In this paper, we propose a new modular approach for developing the psycho-counselling chatbots called the Micro-Conversation Scheme (MC Scheme), which can isolate a single-topic or therapeutic target, 
e.g., to settle a plan, to identify confidence of completing a goal, and design them as separate brief dialogues with average 10 interactions. 
The scheme can modularise the development of  psycho-counselling chatbot which in results the dialogue can be easily modularised thereby reducing the complexity of the development and simultaneously allowing the extensibility of the chatbot. 
The extensibility is established by a model called ’Connector’ to help the chatbot determine the availability and ranking of various micro-conversations based on the user context and dialogue history resulting in more personalised counselling. 
Moreover, the MC scheme integrate a natural language generation (NLG) models as plugin to flexibly generate therapeutic utterances, such as reflection and affirmation. 
Ultimately, we conduct an evaluation showing that our proposed scheme can address the challenges of complex-to-design and difficult-to-extend for counselling chatbots, as well as the inability of psycho-counselling chatbots to flexibly generate therapeutic utterances.
